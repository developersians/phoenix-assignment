# Phoenix Subscription Management System

## Please keep in mind that performing the 'Update-Database' command in Package Manager Console would be required before running the application.

1- Implemented using clean architecture and DDD pattern to enforce business logic in the domain layer, and also having better maintainability.

2- We should leverage a modular monolith, vertical slices, IBusinessRule, and better validations for an enterprise project. Also, we may use CQRS to separate the read and persist sides of the business.

3- It took about 6 hours to implement functionality in a clean and DDD way.

4- I used ChatGPT and DeepSeek to solve the connection issue to the local SQL Server DB. I encountered a weird problem.
