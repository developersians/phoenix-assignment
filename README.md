# Phoenix Subscription Management System

1- Implemented using clean architecture and DDD pattern to enforce business logic in the domain layer, and also having better maintainability.

2- For an enterprise project, we should leverage a modular monolith, vertical slices, IBusinessRule, and better validations. Also we may user CQRS to separate read and persist sides of the business.

3- It took about 6 hours to implement functionality in a clean and DDD way.

4- I used ChatGPT and DeepSeek to solve the connection issue to the local SQL Server DB. I encountered a weird problem.
